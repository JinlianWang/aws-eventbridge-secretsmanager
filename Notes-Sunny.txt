Here are couple things that were not covered in the orignal README. 

* To install AWS CDK, run the following command in your terminal: `npm install -g aws-cdk`.

* Use `npm install` to install all required npm packages. 

* Look like you have to install and start docker daemon first. Otherwise, it would error "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?", when running `cdk deploy`. 

* Use `cdk bootstrap` to boostrap cdk. It will create a CDK toolkit stack in cloudformation. 

* Use ` cdk deploy` to deploy cdk. It will create a new stack in cloudformation for the secrets manager lifecycle stack.
